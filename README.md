### 2. AI Compliance Visual Inspector - 📋 Lightweight object detection
[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-Try_Prototype-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThiSecur/Security-AI-Agent-Vision)   
**A Vision AI Agent live for security cameras to:**  

- Policy violation detection:
  - Unattended devices (phones, laptops)
  - Clean-desk violations
   - Employees/Visitors without badges
   - Paper, pen, pencil, unathourized devices at production
   - Open or damaged doors/windows
   - Any other clean desk policy your company have 
- Expected Release: Q4 2025

### 3. Security AI Agent Command Center (Beta) 🛡️  
[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗-Try_Beta-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ThiSecur/security-ai-agent)  
This Security AI Agent Command Center, is a demo of an AI-powered security system that detects objects (like people, bags, vehicles, etc.) in real-time using computer vision.  
The live version on Hugging Face is a lightweight demo trained on COCO128 (a general-purpose dataset), while the full version is a more advanced system trained on security-specific data for real-world threat detection.  

Key Features:
- Real-Time Object Detection: Identifies objects in images/video (e.g., "person," "backpack").  
- Security-Focused: The full version is optimized for threats (e.g., intrusions, unattended items).  
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple upload/click-to-run design.  

**Current Limitations (for the demo):**  
- Training Data: This demo runs on a general-purpose dataset (COCO128), so it may not catch security-specific threats as accurately as our full version (trained on millions of security-optimized images).  
- Video Support: The live video feature isn’t enabled at the Hugging Face demo —but check out my other AI models for real-time object detection in videos and security cameras!
